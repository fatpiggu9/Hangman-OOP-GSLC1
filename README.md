For Object Oriented Programming GSLC 1 Assignment, I have created a simple Hangman Game.
Hangman is a word guessing game where each user is prompted to guess a word letter by letter, 
and if the letter exists on the hidden word, then the word is automatically pushed into the hidden word.
On the other hand, when the user guessed the wrong letter, a sequence of man being hanged is drew on the map array.
With total of 6 guesses, user could try and try to find out what the hidden letter is and at the same time, 
avoiding the man being hanged completely.

1. After running the code, the output should look like the image below:

2. If the user guessed the right letter, the output will continue to push the letter into the hidden word

3. Once the user succesfully guessed the word, there will be a congratulation message and how many guesses remaining

4. If the user failed to guess a letter, a man hanging will be drawn and added each time user failed to guess the letter

5. Each failure will also be incremented and shown to the user how many chance(s) remains for them before they lose the game
